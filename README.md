# movie_recommender

Refactoring for this project is due. Also, I might add some algorithms I studied and implemented when I was learning Java to get more powerfull recommending. As of right now, it's mostly a web to search for movies based on several filters and get pretty random recommendations, solely based on genre and basic filters like that and whatnot. Also, I'll see about getting a bigger movie database; I'll have to search through some APIs to see if I find something that can easily provide me with useful data. Until then...it's functional and it was kind of fun to do so I'll leave it here until I want to work on it again...
